Sync Evolver assets with the EvoMap Hub.

```bash
EVOLVER="evolver"; command -v evolver >/dev/null 2>&1 || EVOLVER="npx -y @evomap/evolver"
$EVOLVER sync $ARGUMENTS
```

After it runs, summarize: how many assets were pulled/updated, any local-only (unpublished) assets it listed, and — if `--export` was given — where the `.gepx` archive was written.

If it reports the node identity or Hub credentials are missing, point the user to `/evolver:status` and the README's *EvoMap Hub* section to diagnose.
